Example #1 using Derelict and SDL2 in D (dlang)
Creates a window and loads an image.

1. Install the following packages:
* libsdl2-dev
* libsdl2-image-dev

eg. for Debian based systems:

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev`

2. Run `dub` from your terminal

The example will build and execute automatically.
This will create a hidden `.dub` directory and add `.gitignore` file
